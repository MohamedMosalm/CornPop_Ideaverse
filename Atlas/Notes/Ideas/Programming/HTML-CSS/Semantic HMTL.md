- That certain elements have a meaning or a purpose attached to them.
- So when we think about a certain HTML element, we should not think what that element looks like as it's rendered on the page but instead, we should think we should think about *what that element actually means and what it stand
s for*.
- Not all elements in HTML are semantic, 
 - We talk about it before at [[Text Elements HTML#Bold Text|Bold]] and [[Text Elements HTML#Italic text|Italic]]
 - We talk about it in [[HTML Fundementals#Structuring our page]],
   For example, `<nav>` all it does is to represent the meaning that this is a navigation.

Also we can found it at paragraphs, That paragraph is boxes that holds text but have the meaning that *It's a paragraph*
We can replace it for example with `div` but in this case, it will have no meaning.
