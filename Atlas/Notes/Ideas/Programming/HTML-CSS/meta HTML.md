- It is mean data about the data.
- `meta` is element without a closing tag [[Self-Closing Elements HTML]]
```html
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8"/>
	<!-- UTF-8 have all characters that we use at English -->
</head>
```

We saw it before at [[Setting Up the HTML Document Structure#charset|charset]]; It's a [[Attributes HTML|attribute]] for `meta`
