Cloud computing is a way for businesses to use technology in a flexible and scalable manner. Instead of hosting everything on a local server, they can access computing resources, like storage and applications, through the internet. This allows them to easily customize their applications from anywhere with an internet connection. Cloud computing also makes it easier to market applications and saves costs on maintenance.

بيقولوا عليها pay-as-you-go يعني الدفع عند الإستخدام

The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines cloud computing as a model that provides convenient and on-demand access to a shared pool of computing resources. These resources can be quickly provided or released with minimal effort.

Cloud computing has five important characteristics:

1. On-demand self-service: You can access cloud resources whenever you need them, like using an ATM or a vending machine.
2. Broad network access: Cloud resources can be accessed through the internet from any device with internet connectivity.
3. Resource pooling: Cloud providers can share computing resources among multiple users, which helps save costs.
4. Rapid elasticity: You can easily increase or decrease the amount of resources you use based on your needs.
5. Measured service: You only pay for the resources you actually use, similar to how you pay for electricity based on your usage.

## Professionals
- Cloud computing is about on-demand and self-serving access to services, where developers can log into a portal and get the exact amount of services they need.
- It allows the deployment of code or infrastructure anywhere in the world and at scale, with key characteristics like distribution, high availability, resiliency, and scalability.
- Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet, including servers, databases, networking, and analytics. It offers flexible cost, global scale, reduced time to deploy resources, higher productivity and performance, and higher reliability and security.
- Cloud computing provides unlimited compute, database, and machine learning capacity, with the cloud provider managing the physical security of the service.
- It can be seen as a suite of API-driven services to manage all aspects of compute networking resources, with resources that are elastic and can grow or shrink with demand.
- Cloud computing is not a yes or no, but a scale. It can be used for specific tasks like authentication or for hosting entire projects on a cloud-based infrastructure.
- Cloud computing abstracts away the management of things you don't care about, allowing you to focus on what you do care about.
- With high-performance compute in the cloud, you can have extremely fast clusters of computers at your fingertips and only pay for them when you need them. This enables smaller companies to set up high-performance compute clusters and innovate rapidly.
## History and Evolution
- Cloud computing is an evolution of technology that dates back to the 1950s when large-scale mainframes became available.
- Time sharing or resource pooling evolved to efficiently use the computing power of mainframes.
- In the 1970s, the concept of virtual machines (VMs) emerged, allowing multiple virtual systems to run on a single physical node.
- Virtualization became a technological driver and led to significant advancements in communications and computing.
- With the internet becoming more accessible, servers were virtualized into shared hosting environments, virtual private servers, and virtual dedicated servers.
- Companies started making cloud computing accessible to users who didn't have an abundance of physical servers.
- The pay-as-you-go or utility computing model became one of the key drivers behind cloud computing's launch.
- This model allowed companies and developers to pay for computing resources as and when they used them, similar to paying for units of electricity.
- Cloud computing offers benefits such as scalability, cost-effectiveness, and a shift from capital expenditures to operational expenditures.

- تقديم خدمات ال IT عن طريق الإنترنت (DB, Networking, Storage, Computing like servers)
- بتتحاسب على اللي استخدمته في آخر الشهر
- ال Cloud اللي هو ال Internet - وال Cloud Computing هي الحوسبة عن طريق الإنترنت
- ال cloud عبارة عن data centres عملاقة منتشرة في أنحاء العالم وبيبقا فيه عشرات الألاف من السيرفرات
