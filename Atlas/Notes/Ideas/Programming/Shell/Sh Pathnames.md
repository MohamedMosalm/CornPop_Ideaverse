We will discuss “Pathnames” (that is the location of directory or file in system)
We have two types: 
1. absolute: from root `/`
2. relative: from working directory 
   e.g. `cd /user/bin` ⇒ that’s an absolute 
   e.g. `cd ./bin` ⇒ that’s a relative and we can replace it with cd bin
`”.” dot` mean working directory 
`”..” dot dot` mean parent of working directory  ^7c6b8f
