- A¬†**signal**¬†is an event generated by the UNIX and Linux systems in response to some condition
- If we received a signal, a [[Sh Process]] may take action.
- A signal is just like an interrupt; when it is generated at the user level, a call is made to the kernel of the OS, which then acts accordingly.
There are two types of signals:
- **Maskable**: signals which can be changed or ignored by the user (e.g., Ctrl+C).
- **Non-Maskable**: signals which cannot be changed or ignored by the user. These typically occur when the user is signaled for non-recoverable hardware errors.
## Signals Lis

| **Signal** | **Description**                                                                                           |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SIG_HUP_   | **Hang-up** detected on controlling terminal or death of controlling process. ÿ™ŸàŸÇŸÅ                        |
| SIG_INT_   | Issued if the user sends an **interrupt signal** (Ctrl + C).                                              |
| SIG_QUIT_  | Issued if the user sends a **quit signal** (Ctrl + D).                                                    |
| SIG_FPE_   | Issued if an **illegal mathematical operation** is attempted.                                             |
| SIG_KILL_  | If a process gets this signal, **it must quit immediately** and will not perform any clean-up operations. |
| SIG_TERM_  | Software **termination signal** (sent kill by default).                                                   |
| SIG_ALRM_  | **Alarm** clock signal (used for timers).                                                                 |
- We will use it a lot with [[Sh pkill command]]
