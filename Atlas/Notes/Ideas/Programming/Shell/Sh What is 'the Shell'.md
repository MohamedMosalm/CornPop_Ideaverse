## What is "the Shell"?
- The shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform.
- On most Linux systems a program called `bash` (which stands for Bourne Again SHell, an enhanced version of the original Unix shell program, `sh`, written by Steve Bourne) acts as the shell program. Besides bash, there are other shell programs available for Linux systems. These include: `ksh`, `tcsh` and `zsh`.
## What's a "Terminal"?
- It's a program called a terminal emulator. 
- This is a program that opens a window and lets you interact with the shell. 
- There are a bunch of different terminal emulators we can use. 
- Some Linux distributions install several. 
- These might include `gnome-terminal`, `konsole`, `xterm`, `rxvt`, `kvt`, `nxterm`, and `eterm`.
