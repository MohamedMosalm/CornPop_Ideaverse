- We talked before about [[OOP]]
- Python supports Object Oriented Programming
- Python is multi-paradigm Programming Language ([[Procedural]], [[OOP]], [[Functional]])
	- Procedural: Structure app like Recipe, sets of steps to make the task
    - Functional: Built on the concept of Mathematical Functions

- **Everything in Python is Object** ^6e7797
- [[Py class]] is the template for creating objects (Object Constructor, Blueprint)
## 4 Principles
We will learn major principles of object-orientation:
1. [[Py Encapsulation]]
2. [[Py Abstraction]]
3. [[Py Polymorphism]]
4. [[Py Inheritance]]
## Classes/Objects
The main thing in OOP is [[Py object]] which is created from [[Py class]]
## Attributes and Methods
- [[Py Attributes]] are created inside a class definition and Object can have arbitrary attributes
- [[Py methods]] are functions but in class.
