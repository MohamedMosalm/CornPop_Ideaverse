We have two types of testing which are Black Box and White Box

__Black-Box testing__: You provide input to the system and wait for the output but you don't know anything ab
out the internal structure of the system.
__White Box testing__: You have access to the internal structure of the system. (code)
__Gray Box testing__: You have partial access to the system.

Black Box test technique is mainly applied in __System testing__ and __Acceptance testing__

### Example
If we want to test a calculator application so in Black Box testing we will provide inputs and wait for outputs. 
I don't know how the application handles this input
