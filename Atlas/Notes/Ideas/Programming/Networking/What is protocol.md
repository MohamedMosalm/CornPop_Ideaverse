## What is a network [[Protocol]]?
- A network protocol is a set of established rules that specify how to format, send and receive data 
- so that computer network endpoints, including computers, servers, routers and virtual machines, **can communicate** despite على الرغم differences in their underlying infrastructures, designs or standards.
- To successfully send and receive information, devices on both sides of a communication exchange must accept and follow protocol conventions.
- Without network protocols, computers and other devices would not know how to engage with each other.
## How network protocols work: The OSI model
- In the standard model, known as the Open Systems Interconnection [[OSI model]], one or more network protocols govern activities at each layer in the telecommunication exchange.
- Lower layers deal with data transport, while the upper layers in the OSI model deal with software and applications.
- Every packet transmitted and received over a network contains binary data. 
- Most computing protocols add a header at the beginning of each network packet to store information about the sender and the message's intended destination.
- Some protocols may also include a footer at the end with additional information.
- Network protocols process these headers and footers as part of the data moving among devices in order to identify messages of their own kind.
