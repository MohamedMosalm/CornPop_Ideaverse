## Example (IRL)
Imagine you are sitting in a restaurant and have selected your order. 
The menu outlines a list of food items, and the corresponding meals are prepared in the kitchen. 
Your **waiter** is the link between you and the kitchen, who communicates your order to the kitchen and returns the food back to you. 
This **communication** is similar to how **APIs** work. 
An API is analogous to a waiter, as it communicates a request from one device to another, and returns the response back to the first device.

The **menu** in the example is the **API documentation**. 
In a restaurant, if you order a food item which does not exist on the menu, the waiter will inform you that it is an invalid choice, and will be incapable of delivering the food item. 
Similarly, each API has documentation that outlines the requests you are allowed to make, and the type of response you should expect to receive. 
If you try to make an invalid request, you will come across an error.
