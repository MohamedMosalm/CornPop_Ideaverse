- We will use React
- If we used HTML, CSS and JS but this called vanilla JS
	- We write code HTML and browser convert it to -> DOM (Document Object Model) tree of notes and we can change nodes with JS (make it dynamic)

- React is divide page into components and we can use it:
	- Nav Bar (Login - signup - ..)
