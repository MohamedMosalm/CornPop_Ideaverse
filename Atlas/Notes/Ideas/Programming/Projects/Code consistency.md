- Use Camel Case to name classes (`BaseModel`)
- User underscore to name another things like methods and variables (`do_create`)
- You need to match the naming of functions like `do_create, do_delete` or `create, delete`
- The Macros and Constants should be in CAPS (`LIMIT = 3200`)
- You should document
 everything 
- Refactor the code and you will use functions you will never know before
